      <h1>Cross-cultural training</h1>
      <h2>Orientation for working and living in Hungary</h2>

      <p>
        This training is designed for international professionals and organisations who experience friction,
        misunderstandings, or operational slowdowns after relocation – without being able to clearly identify the cause.
      </p>

      <p>
        Rather than focusing on surface-level cultural tips, the training provides <strong>orientation</strong>:
        a way to understand what is happening beneath everyday interactions, and how to respond to it with greater
        confidence and precision.
      </p>

    <section id="structure">
      <h2>How the training is built</h2>
      <h3>From orientation to confidence</h3>

      <p>
        The training is not structured as a fixed set of modules.
        It follows an <strong>orientation arc</strong> that helps participants gradually move from uncertainty to clarity:
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>orientation → interpretation → practical situations</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        Participants are introduced to relevant cultural and historical context only where it directly supports
        understanding real-life situations. Background knowledge is always connected to lived experience –
        workplace interactions, social settings, and everyday moments where expectations and reactions do not align.
      </p>

      <p>
        The emphasis is not on theoretical learning, but on recognising patterns in situations that participants
        already encounter, often without having the tools to interpret them clearly.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="boundaries">
      <h2>What this training is not</h2>
      <h3>Clear boundaries</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>not a rulebook</li>
        <li>not a list of do’s and don’ts</li>
        <li>not a behavioural checklist</li>
        <li>not a political or ideological narrative</li>
        <li>not a touristic introduction to Hungary</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        By avoiding prescriptive formulas, the training ensures that what participants learn remains applicable
        across contexts, rather than tied to rigid scripts or specific scenarios.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="outcomes">
      <h2>Where this leads</h2>
      <h3>From understanding to connection</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>more confident presence in everyday and professional situations</li>
        <li>fewer misunderstandings and unnecessary escalations</li>
        <li>clearer communication and expectation management</li>
        <li>stronger, more functional working relationships</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The result is not conformity, but <strong>agency</strong>:
        the ability to navigate Hungarian cultural contexts with understanding, proportion, and confidence.
      </p>

      <p>
        This foundation can be applied both in individual relocation contexts and in organisational settings
        where international teams operate within Hungarian cultural environments.
      </p>

    <section id="formats">
      <h2>Formats</h2>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Individual sessions</strong> for relocating professionals</li>
        <li><strong>Group trainings</strong> for international teams</li>
        <li><strong>Tailored corporate programmes</strong> in cooperation with HR and relocation partners</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Formats are adapted to the specific situation rather than delivered as standardised packages.
