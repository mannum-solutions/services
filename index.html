      <h1>Services</h1>
      <p>
        I provide strategy-focused advisory support for senior leaders and organisations
        facing complex, high-stakes decisions. The work is not about delivering predefined
        solutions, but about creating clarity, structure, and decision readiness in
        situations where direction is unclear or contested.
      </p>

      <h2>Executive Strategy Advisory</h2>
      <p>
        Support for leaders navigating strategic uncertainty, competing priorities,
        or ambiguous organisational contexts. This includes reframing strategic questions,
        identifying constraints and leverage points, and supporting sound decision-making
        under complexity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Typical situations include organisational change, role transitions, strategy
        realignment, and cross-functional tension at senior levels.
      </p>

      <h2>Decision-Making Support</h2>
      <p>
        Advisory work focused on how decisions are formed, framed, and enacted.
        The emphasis is on improving decision quality rather than accelerating
        decision speed.
      </p>
      <p>
        This work helps leaders understand what is truly decidable in a given situation,
        what remains structurally uncertain, and how their position within the system
        shapes available paths forward.
      </p>

      <h2>Leadership and Organisational Perspective</h2>
      <p>
        Support at the intersection of individual leadership roles and organisational
        structures. The focus is on how roles, expectations, and information flows
        interact in practice - not only on formal org charts.
      </p>
      <p>
        This service is particularly relevant where leadership challenges cannot be
        separated from organisational design, culture, or systemic constraints.

      <h2>What This Is Not</h2>
      <p>
        This is not management consultancy in the traditional sense, not a coaching
        programme, and not a delivery or implementation service. The advisory work
        remains focused on thinking, framing, and decision support.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you are exploring whether this type of advisory support is relevant for a
        specific situation, an initial exploratory conversation is usually the best
        starting point.
