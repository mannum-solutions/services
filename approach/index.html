    <h1>Approach</h1>
    <!-- Core principles guiding the advisory process -->
    <section>
      <h2>Principles</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Context before solutions: understanding the broader system before acting.</li>
        <li>Structure before action: building a solid frame for decision‑making.</li>
        <li>Decisions as topologies: viewing choices within a landscape of possibilities.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- Workflow: outline the working process without jargon -->
    <section>
      <h2>Process</h2>
      <p>Describe a simple sequence from diagnosis to framing and follow‑through, avoiding buzzwords.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Collaboration style: emphasise advisory, reflective, outcome‑oriented collaboration -->
    <section>
      <h2>Collaboration Style</h2>
      <p>Clarify that the partnership is advisory rather than prescriptive, reflective yet focused on outcomes — an important distinction for HR.</p>
