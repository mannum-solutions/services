      <h2>The situation we work with</h2>
      <h3>Relocation is not a logistics problem</h3>

      <p>
        Relocation rarely becomes difficult where people expect it to.  
        In most cases, friction does not come from administration, housing, or formal processes, but from <strong>implicit cultural rules</strong> – the things nobody explains, yet everyone silently assumes.
      </p>

      <p>
        What newcomers often experience as “something feels off” is not a personal failure, nor a lack of competence.  
        It is an <strong>interpretive gap between two cultural logics</strong>. Signals are read differently, reactions are weighted differently, and intentions do not always land where they were meant to.
      </p>

      <p>
        This training does not pathologise these situations.  
        It treats them as <strong>normal, structurally understandable moments</strong> that emerge whenever people move between cultural systems.  
        The goal is not to eliminate difference, but to make it legible.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our approach is not instructional and not prescriptive.  
        We work with precise information, but always from the assumption that participants are already capable professionals – operating with a different cultural code.  
        The task is not correction, but <strong>orientation</strong>.

      <h2>What we mean by culture</h2>
      <h3>Culture is not only customs, but patterns</h3>

      <p>
        In this training, culture is clearly separated from etiquette lists and surface-level “do’s and don’ts”.  
        Culture is not treated as a collection of habits, but as a <strong>system of patterns</strong> that shape how people interpret situations and respond to one another.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>how rules are perceived and applied</li>
        <li>how disagreement and conflict are signalled and managed</li>
        <li>how authority and hierarchy are approached</li>
        <li>how directness, distance, and familiarity are calibrated</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Hungarian culture, in this sense, is not accidental.  
        It functions as an internally coherent system shaped by historical layers, collective experiences, and a specific cultural self-image.
      </p>

      <p>
        These dimensions are present throughout the training, but not as abstract theory.  
        They appear as <strong>context</strong> – background logic that helps participants understand why certain reactions, behaviours, or communication styles feel unexpected, disproportionate, or ambiguous in everyday and professional situations.
      </p>

      <p>
        The focus is not on learning cultural facts, but on recognising <strong>recurring patterns</strong> that make present-day interactions intelligible.
