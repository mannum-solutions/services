      <h1>Cultural empathy as a skill</h1>
      <h2>Adaptation is not imitation</h2>

      <p>
        Cultural empathy is often misunderstood as a matter of attitude or goodwill.
        In reality, it functions much more like a <strong>situational skill</strong> – something that can be learned, refined, and applied with increasing precision.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the context of relocation and cross-cultural work, empathy does not mean accepting everything, blending in uncritically, or attempting to “become local”.
        Imitation is rarely authentic, and it is rarely sustainable.
      </p>

      <p>
        What tends to work instead is the ability to <strong>read situations accurately</strong> and respond in proportion to what is actually taking place.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>sensitivity to contextual signals</li>
        <li>a sense of proportion in response</li>
        <li>the ability to choose situation-specific reactions instead of relying on reflexes</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Rather than rehearsing ideal behaviours, the focus is on developing <strong>interpretive capacity</strong> –
        recognising what kind of interaction one is in, and what kind of response the situation actually calls for.
      </p>

      <p>
        This becomes especially important in moments that appear tense or ambiguous.
        In many cultural contexts, including Hungary, <strong>not every signal of tension indicates a real conflict</strong>.
        Smoke is not fire.
      </p>

      <p>
        Positions are often signalled before they are stated directly, and disagreement may be communicated indirectly
        long before it becomes explicit.
      </p>

      <p>
        Effective responses in such situations are rarely a matter of assertiveness or restraint alone.
        They are a matter of <strong>precision</strong> – understanding when to respond, how strongly, and in what register.
      </p>

      <p>
        Cultural empathy, in this sense, is not about adapting one’s identity.
        It is about maintaining agency while navigating unfamiliar cultural logics with clarity, proportion, and confidence.
