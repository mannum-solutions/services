Project Intent by Mannum Solutions

This repository contains the source of a static executive advisory website.

The purpose of the site is to clearly articulate a strategy-focused advisory offering for corporate HR partners and senior decision-makers. It is designed to communicate how complex leadership, organisational, and strategic decision situations can be approached with clarity, structure, and contextual understanding.

The site presents:

the advisory focus and scope,

the underlying way of thinking and working,

selected anonymised cases and insights,

and a clear entry point for exploratory conversations.

This is not a consultancy agency site, a coaching platform, or a product catalogue.
It does not aim to sell predefined solutions, methodologies, or packaged frameworks.
Instead, it positions advisory work as context-specific, reflective, and outcome-oriented strategic support for leaders operating in complex environments.

The site is intentionally minimal, content-driven, and statically structured to ensure clarity, credibility, and long-term maintainability.
